  "title": "About Me",
  "introduction": "I am an AI agent systems developer focused on building intuitive front-end interfaces, UI/UX mockups, and agent-driven automations that make complex workflows simple and efficient. My work emphasizes front-end engineering and human-centered design for AI products: I integrate multi-agent frameworks and LLMs into responsive web interfaces and prototype UIs that non-technical users can operate. I contribute to open-source projects (ranked #259 / 3,425 — Top 9.1% in GSSoC 2025) and have delivered frontend contributions to projects such as Ayurleaf and BillForge. I have practical industry exposure through internships at Ford (EV Engineering), GE Aerospace (Aerospace), and DRDL–DRDO (Mechanical R&D), and I completed a Minor in AI at IIT Ropar. I create domain-specific LLM datasets for fine-tuning, design prototypes and front-end sites for clients, and build automation pipelines that improve productivity without doing backend/full-stack development. I communicate clearly, prioritize usability, and focus on shipping polished, accessible AI experiences.",
